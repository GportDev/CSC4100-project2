			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

In struct thread (thread.h):
  int64_t wakeup_tick;                /* Tick when thread should wake up. */

In timer.c:
  static struct list sleeping_list;   /* List of sleeping threads, sorted by wakeup_tick. */
  static int64_t next_wakeup_tick;    /* Earliest wakeup time. Used to skip unnecessary checks. */

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

timer_sleep():
1. Calculate wakeup_tick = current_tick + ticks_to_sleep
2. Disable interrupts
3. Insert thread into sleeping_list (sorted by wakeup_tick)
4. Update next_wakeup_tick if needed
5. Block thread with thread_block()
6. Re-enable interrupts when woken up

Timer interrupt handler:
- If current tick >= next_wakeup_tick, call check_sleeping_threads()
- check_sleeping_threads() iterates sleeping_list and wakes threads whose wakeup_tick has passed
- Updates next_wakeup_tick to next earliest wakeup time

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

1. Sorted list allows early exit - stop checking when first thread isn't ready
2. next_wakeup_tick optimization - only scan list when ticks >= next_wakeup_tick
3. List insertion happens in timer_sleep(), not in interrupt handler

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

timer_sleep() disables interrupts before modifying sleeping_list and next_wakeup_tick. This prevents
other threads from preempting during the critical section (list insertion and thread_block()).
Interrupts remain disabled until the context switch completes.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

Interrupts are disabled during the entire critical section of timer_sleep() (from list insertion
through thread_block()). This prevents timer interrupts from calling check_sleeping_threads() while
sleeping_list is being modified.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

Sorted list with next_wakeup_tick optimization:

Advantages:
- Sorted list allows early exit when checking for threads to wake (often O(1) instead of O(n))
- next_wakeup_tick lets handler skip list entirely when no threads are ready
- Blocks threads instead of busy-waiting, freeing CPU for other work
- Uses existing Pintos list primitives for simplicity

Alternative considered: Unsorted list would require checking all sleeping threads every tick.
Alternative considered: Priority queue/heap adds complexity without significant benefit for typical
small numbers of sleeping threads.

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct thread
  {
    int original_priority;             /* Original priority before donation. */
    struct list donations;             /* List of threads that donated priority. */
    struct list_elem donation_elem;    /* List element for donation list. */
    struct lock *waiting_lock;         /* Lock the thread is waiting on. */
  };

struct list waiters
  {
    struct list waiters;   /* List of waiting threads. */
  }

bool thread_priority_compare(...); /* Comparator: return true if A has higher priority than B */
void thread_donate_priority(...);  /* Helper function to donate priority for a thread */
void thread_update_priority(...);  /* Added function to update priority after a donation */
void remove_donors_for_lock(...);  /* remove donrs for a specific lock */

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

Each thread has a base_priority, priority, a list of donations, and a waiting_on pointer.
The base_priority does not change during donation. Waiting_on points to the lock the thread
waiting for.

Initial state:
Thread H (priority 32) wants lock A held by M (priority 31) 
Thread M (priority 31) wants lock B held by L (priority 30)

Before donation:
    H(32) -- waiting_on --> [Lock A]
                              V holder
                            M(31) -- waiting_on --> [Lock B]
                                                      V holder
                                                    L(30)

After nested donation:
    H(32) -- waiting_on --> [Lock A]
       V                     V holder
    donors        -->       M(32) -- waiting_on --> [Lock B]
                               V                      V  holder
                             donors         --->     L(32)

Both M and L now have effective priority 32 (donated from H).

Thread structure:
H: base_priority=32, priority=32, waiting_on=Lock A, donors=[]
M: base_priority=31, priority=32, waiting_on=Lock B, donors=[H]
L: base_priority=30, priority=32, waiting_on=NULL, donors=[M(which has H)]
